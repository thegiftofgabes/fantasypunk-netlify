A set of concepts for exploration procedures.

# Exploration Moves

When travelling through the world, you enter the Exploration phase. You can use these moves when exploring.

## Prepare

When you prepare for the journey ahead, be Mindful.

## Set Out

When you set out into the wilds, ask each party member for 1 hope they have for the road ahead and 1 fear. Also, answer these 3 questions:

- Is the group stocked up?
- Is the group free of duress or any injury that may inhibit their journey?
- Has the group eluded dangerous attention in the area?

One party member rolls 1d6 for every time the group could answer yes to the above questions. 

On a solid hit, the GM chooses 2 hopes to be realized along the way. On a messy hit, the GM chooses 1 hope and 1 fear to be realized. On a miss, The GM chooses 2 fears to be realized, this is going to be a long journey.

## Roam

When the party **roams** the world without a specific goal or destiny, roll 2d6. Use the lowest die to pick a Theme and the other to pick a Domain, then do it a second time to pick a second Theme and a second Domain.

## Arrive

When you arrive at a new location, choose 2 Themes for that location and a Domain from each Theme. You can choose the same Theme twice but not the same Domain. 

If that place is a landmark, settlement or otherwise remarkable place, you may name it.

## Delve

When you guide the party through a dangerous or unfamiliar place, roll Curious. 

On a hit, gain 1 token. On a sound hit choose 2 from below. On a messy hit choose 1:

- This area contains something valuable or useful;
- This area’s residents are not immediately hostile;
- You find a clue to the true nature of this place or an important insight about its denizens.

Spend 1 token to Return to an area you’ve visited before Spend 3 tokens to find the heart of the area, or locate someone or something you are attempting to track down.

idea: the area tells history (maybe myriad hex tyle?)

## Catch your Breath

When you **catch your breath** during exploration, each party member describes 1 risk of resting here.

You get as many tokens as the dice you rolled.

Any party member can spend these tokens to do the following:

- Let go of 3 Weight;
- Recover a spent Heritage Tag use.

For this move, lower results are more desirable. 

On a result of 1 to 3, your rest is uneventful.

On a roll of 4 or 5, the GM chooses a risk and it comes to pass.

On a roll of 6, the GM chooses two risks to come to pass.
